    abstract:
      content: <p>Formally, any DNS Resource Record (RR) may occur under any domain
        name. However, some services use an operational convention for defining specific
        interpretations of an RRset by locating the records in a DNS branch under
        the parent domain to which the RRset actually applies. The top of this subordinate
        branch is defined by a naming convention that uses a reserved node name, which
        begins with the underscore character (e.g., "_name"). The underscored naming
        construct defines a semantic scope for DNS record types that are associated
        with the parent domain above the underscored branch. This specification explores
        the nature of this DNS usage and defines the "Underscored and Globally Scoped
        DNS Node Names" registry with IANA. The purpose of this registry is to avoid
        collisions resulting from the use of the same underscored name for different
        services.</p>

    abstract:
      content: "<p>Using an underscore for a prefix creates a space for constrained
        interoperation of resource records. Original uses of an underscore character
        as a domain node name prefix were specified without the benefit of an IANA
        registry. This produced an entirely uncoordinated set of name-creation activities,
        all drawing from the same namespace. A registry for these names has now been
        defined by RFC 8552. However, the existing specifications that use underscored
        naming need to be modified in order to be in line with the new registry. This
        document specifies those changes. The changes preserve existing software and
        operational practice, while adapting the specifications for those practices
        to the newer underscore registry model.</p>"
