    abstract:
    - content: "<p>When experimenting with or extending protocols, it is often necessary
        to use some sort of protocol number or constant in order to actually test
        or experiment with the new function, even when testing in a closed environment.
        For example, to test a new DHCP option, one needs an option number to identify
        the new function. This document recommends that when writing IANA Considerations
        sections, authors should consider assigning a small range of numbers for experimentation
        purposes that implementers can use when testing protocol extensions or other
        new features. This document reserves some ranges of numbers for experimentation
        purposes in specific protocols where the need to support experimentation has
        been identified.</p>"
