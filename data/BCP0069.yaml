    abstract:
    - content: "<p>This document describes TCP performance problems that arise because
        of asymmetric effects. These problems arise in several access networks, including
        bandwidth-asymmetric networks and packet radio subnetworks, for different
        underlying reasons. However, the end result on TCP performance is the same
        in both cases: performance often degrades significantly because of imperfection
        and variability in the ACK feedback from the receiver to the sender. The document
        details several mitigations to these effects, which have either been proposed
        or evaluated in the literature, or are currently deployed in networks. These
        solutions use a combination of local link- layer techniques, subnetwork, and
        end-to-end mechanisms, consisting of: (i) techniques to manage the channel
        used for the upstream bottleneck link carrying the ACKs, typically using header
        compression or reducing the frequency of TCP ACKs, (ii) techniques to handle
        this reduced ACK frequency to retain the TCP sender's acknowledgment-triggered
        self- clocking and (iii) techniques to schedule the data and ACK packets in
        the reverse direction to improve performance in the presence of two-way traffic.
        Each technique is described, together with known issues, and recommendations
        for use. A summary of the recommendations is provided at the end of the document.
        This document specifies an Internet Best Current Practices for the Internet
        Community, and requests discussion and suggestions for improvements.</p>"
