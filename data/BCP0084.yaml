    abstract:
    - content: "<p>BCP 38, RFC 2827, is designed to limit the impact of distributed
        denial of service attacks, by denying traffic with spoofed addresses access
        to the network, and to help ensure that traffic is traceable to its correct
        source network. As a side effect of protecting the Internet against such attacks,
        the network implementing the solution also protects itself from this and other
        attacks, such as spoofed management access to networking equipment. There
        are cases when this may create problems, e.g., with multihoming. This document
        describes the current ingress filtering operational mechanisms, examines generic
        issues related to ingress filtering, and delves into the effects on multihoming
        in particular. This memo updates RFC 2827. This document specifies an Internet
        Best Current Practices for the Internet Community, and requests discussion
        and suggestions for improvements.</p>"

    abstract:
    - content: "<p>This document identifies a need for and proposes improvement of
        the unicast Reverse Path Forwarding (uRPF) techniques (see RFC 3704) for detection
        and mitigation of source address spoofing (see BCP 38). Strict uRPF is inflexible
        about directionality, the loose uRPF is oblivious to directionality, and the
        current feasible-path uRPF attempts to strike a balance between the two (see
        RFC 3704). However, as shown in this document, the existing feasible-path
        uRPF still has shortcomings. This document describes enhanced feasible-path
        uRPF (EFP-uRPF) techniques that are more flexible (in a meaningful way) about
        directionality than the feasible-path uRPF (RFC 3704). The proposed EFP-uRPF
        methods aim to significantly reduce false positives regarding invalid detection
        in source address validation (SAV). Hence, they can potentially alleviate
        ISPs' concerns about the possibility of disrupting service for their customers
        and encourage greater deployment of uRPF techniques. This document updates
        RFC 3704.</p>"
