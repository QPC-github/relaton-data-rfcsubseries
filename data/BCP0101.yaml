        established in 2005. In the years since then, the needs of the IETF evolved
        in ways that required changes to its administrative structure. The purpose
        of this RFC is to document and describe the IETF Administrative Support Activity,
        version 2.0 (IASA 2.0). It defines the roles and responsibilities of the IETF
        Administration LLC Board (IETF LLC Board), the IETF Executive Director, and
        the Internet Society in the fiscal and administrative support of the IETF
        standards process. It also defines the membership and selection rules for
        the IETF LLC Board.</p><p>This document obsoletes RFC 4071, RFC 4333, and
        RFC 7691.</p>"

    - content: <p>In 2018, the IETF began the transition to a new administrative structure
        and updated its IETF Administrative Support Activity (IASA) to a new "IASA
        2.0" structure.  In addition to more substantive changes that are described
        in other documents, the transition to the 2018 IETF Administrative Support
        structure changes several position titles and organizational relationships
        that are referenced elsewhere.  Rather than reissue those referencing documents
        individually, this specification provides updates to them and deprecates some
        now-obsolete documents to ensure that there is no confusion due to these changes.</p>
