    abstract:
    - content: "<p>Implementors of systems that use public key cryptography to exchange
        symmetric keys need to make the public keys resistant to some predetermined
        level of attack. That level of attack resistance is the strength of the system,
        and the symmetric keys that are exchanged must be at least as strong as the
        system strength requirements. The three quantities, system strength, symmetric
        key strength, and public key strength, must be consistently matched for any
        network protocol usage. While it is fairly easy to express the system strength
        requirements in terms of a symmetric key length and to choose a cipher that
        has a key length equal to or exceeding that requirement, it is harder to choose
        a public key that has a cryptographic strength meeting a symmetric key strength
        requirement. This document explains how to determine the length of an asymmetric
        key as a function of a symmetric key strength requirement. Some rules of thumb
        for estimating equivalent resistance to large-scale attacks on various algorithms
        are given. The document also addresses how changing the sizes of the underlying
        large integers (moduli, group sizes, exponents, and so on) changes the time
        to use the algorithms for key exchange. This document specifies an Internet
        Best Current Practices for the Internet Community, and requests discussion
        and suggestions for improvements.</p>"
