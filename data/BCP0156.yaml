    abstract:
      content: <p>During the last few years, awareness has been raised about a number
        of "blind" attacks that can be performed against the Transmission Control
        Protocol (TCP) and similar protocols. The consequences of these attacks range
        from throughput reduction to broken connections or data corruption. These
        attacks rely on the attacker's ability to guess or know the five-tuple (Protocol,
        Source Address, Destination Address, Source Port, Destination Port) that identifies
        the transport protocol instance to be attacked. This document describes a
        number of simple and efficient methods for the selection of the client port
        number, such that the possibility of an attacker guessing the exact value
        is reduced. While this is not a replacement for cryptographic methods for
        protecting the transport-protocol instance, the aforementioned port selection
        algorithms provide improved security with very little effort and without any
        key management overhead. The algorithms described in this document are local
        policies that may be incrementally deployed and that do not violate the specifications
        of any of the transport protocols that may benefit from them, such as TCP,
        UDP, UDP-lite, Stream Control Transmission Protocol (SCTP), Datagram Congestion
        Control Protocol (DCCP), and RTP (provided that the RTP application explicitly
        signals the RTP and RTCP port numbers). This memo documents an Internet Best
        Current Practice.</p>
