    abstract:
    - content: <p>Section 1.1.1 of RFC 3986 defines URI syntax as "a federated and
        extensible naming system wherein each scheme's specification may further restrict
        the syntax and semantics of identifiers using that scheme." In other words,
        the structure of a URI is defined by its scheme. While it is common for schemes
        to further delegate their substructure to the URI's owner, publishing independent
        standards that mandate particular forms of substructure in URIs is often problematic.</p><p>This
        document provides guidance on the specification of URI substructure in standards.</p><p>This
        document obsoletes RFC 7320 and updates RFC 3986.</p>
