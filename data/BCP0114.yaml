    abstract:
    - content: "<p>BGP communities (RFC 1997) are used by service providers for many
        purposes, including tagging of customer, peer, and geographically originated
        routes. Such tagging is typically used to control the scope of redistribution
        of routes within a provider's network and to its peers and customers. With
        the advent of large-scale BGP data collection (and associated research), it
        has become clear that the information carried in such communities is essential
        for a deeper understanding of the global routing system. This memo defines
        standard (outbound) communities and their encodings for export to BGP route
        collectors. This document specifies an Internet Best Current Practices for
        the Internet Community, and requests discussion and suggestions for improvements.</p>"
