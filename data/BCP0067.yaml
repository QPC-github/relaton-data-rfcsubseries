      content: "<p>This memo documents a process intended to organize the future development
        of the Session Initiation Protocol (SIP) and related work in the Real-time
        Applications and Infrastructure (RAI) Area. As the environments in which SIP
        is deployed grow more numerous and diverse, modifying or extending SIP in
        certain ways may threaten the interoperability and security of the protocol;
        however, the IETF process must also cater to the realities of existing deployments
        and serve the needs of the implementers working with SIP. This document therefore
        defines the functions of two long-lived working groups in the RAI Area that
        are, respectively, responsible for the maintenance of the core SIP specifications
        and the development of new efforts to extend and apply work in this space.
        This document obsoletes RFC 3427. This memo documents an Internet Best Current
        Practice.</p>"

        Session Initiation Protocol (SIP) and related protocols, as well as the operation
        of the DISPATCH and SIPCORE working groups. This document updates RFC 5727
        to allow flexibility for the area and working group structure, while preserving
