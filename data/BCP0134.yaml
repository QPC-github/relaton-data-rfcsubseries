    abstract:
    - content: "<p>Email has become a popular distribution service for a variety of
        socially unacceptable, mass-effect purposes. The most obvious ones include
        spam and worms. This note recommends conventions for the operation of email
        submission and transport services between independent operators, such as enterprises
        and Internet Service Providers. Its goal is to improve lines of accountability
        for controlling abusive uses of the Internet mail service. To this end, this
        document offers recommendations for constructive operational policies between
        independent operators of email submission and transmission services.</p><p>Email
        authentication technologies are aimed at providing assurances and traceability
        between internetworked networks. In many email services, the weakest link
        in the chain of assurances is initial submission of a message. This document
        offers recommendations for constructive operational policies for this first
        step of email sending, the submission (or posting) of email into the transmission
        network. Relaying and delivery entail policies that occur subsequent to submission
        and are outside the scope of this document. This document specifies an Internet
        Best Current Practices for the Internet Community, and requests discussion
        and suggestions for improvements.</p>"
