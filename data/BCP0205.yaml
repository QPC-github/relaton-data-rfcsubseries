    abstract:
    - content: "<p>This document describes a simple process that allows authors of
        Internet-Drafts to record the status of known implementations by including
        an Implementation Status section. This will allow reviewers and working groups
        to assign due consideration to documents that have the benefit of running
        code, which may serve as evidence of valuable experimentation and feedback
        that have made the implemented protocols more mature.</p><p>This process is
        not mandatory. Authors of Internet-Drafts are encouraged to consider using
        the process for their documents, and working groups are invited to think about
        applying the process to all of their protocol specifications. This document
        obsoletes RFC 6982, advancing it to a Best Current Practice.</p>"
