        (DTLS) are widely used to protect data exchanged over application protocols
        such as HTTP, SMTP, IMAP, POP, SIP, and XMPP. Over the last few years, several
        serious attacks on TLS have emerged, including attacks on its most commonly
        used cipher suites and their modes of operation. This document provides recommendations
        for improving the security of deployed services that use TLS and DTLS. The
        recommendations are applicable to the majority of use cases.</p>"

    - content: "<p>This document formally deprecates Transport Layer Security (TLS)
        versions 1.0 (RFC 2246) and 1.1 (RFC 4346). Accordingly, those documents have
        been moved to Historic status. These versions lack support for current and
        recommended cryptographic algorithms and mechanisms, and various government
        and industry profiles of applications using TLS now mandate avoiding these
        old TLS versions. TLS version 1.2 became the recommended version for IETF
        protocols in 2008 (subsequently being obsoleted by TLS version 1.3 in 2018),
        providing sufficient time to transition away from older versions. Removing
        support for older versions from implementations reduces the attack surface,
        reduces opportunity for misconfiguration, and streamlines library and product
        maintenance.</p><p>This document also deprecates Datagram TLS (DTLS) version
        1.0 (RFC 4347) but not DTLS version 1.2, and there is no DTLS version 1.1.</p><p>This
        document updates many RFCs that normatively refer to TLS version 1.0 or TLS
        version 1.1, as described herein. This document also updates the best practices
        for TLS usage in RFC 7525; hence, it is part of BCP 195.</p>"
