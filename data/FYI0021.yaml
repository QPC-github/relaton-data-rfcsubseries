    abstract:
    - content: <p>This document is the result of a survey asking people to detail
        their advanced usages of X.500. It is intended to show how various organizations
        are using X.500 in ways which extend the view of X.500 as a "White Pages"
        service. This RFC is a product of the Integrated Directory Services Working
        Group of the Application and User Services Areas of the IETF. This memo provides
        information for the Internet community. It does not specify an Internet standard.</p>
