      content: '<p>The Internet Printing Protocol (IPP) is an application-level protocol
        for distributed printing using Internet tools and technologies. This document
        describes a simplified model consisting of abstract objects, attributes, and
        operations that is independent of encoding and transport. The model consists
        of several objects, including Printers and Jobs. Jobs optionally support multiple
        Documents.</p><p>IPP semantics allow End Users and Operators to query Printer
        capabilities; submit Print Jobs; inquire about the status of Print Jobs and
        Printers; and cancel, hold, and release Print Jobs. IPP semantics also allow
        Operators to pause and resume Jobs and Printers.</p><p>Security, internationalization,
        and directory issues are also addressed by the model and semantics. The IPP
        message encoding and transport are described in "Internet Printing Protocol/1.1:
        Encoding and Transport" (RFC 8010).</p><p>This document obsoletes RFCs 2911,
