    abstract:
    - content: <p>Many protocols must detect packet loss for various reasons (e.g.,
        to ensure reliability using retransmissions or to understand the level of
        congestion along a network path). While many mechanisms have been designed
        to detect loss, ultimately, protocols can only count on the passage of time
        without delivery confirmation to declare a packet "lost". Each implementation
        of a time-based loss detection mechanism represents a balance between correctness
        and timeliness; therefore, no implementation suits all situations. This document
        provides high-level requirements for time-based loss detectors appropriate
        for general use in unicast communication across the Internet. Within the requirements,
        implementations have latitude to define particulars that best address each
        situation.</p>
