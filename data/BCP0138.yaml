    abstract:
    - content: "<p>The specification for enhanced mail system status codes, RFC 3463,
        establishes a new code model and lists a collection of status codes. While
        it anticipated that more codes would be added over time, it did not provide
        an explicit mechanism for registering and tracking those codes. This document
        specifies an IANA registry for mail system enhanced status codes, and initializes
        that registry with the codes so far established in published standards-track
        documents, as well as other codes that have become established in the industry.
        This document specifies an Internet Best Current Practices for the Internet
        Community, and requests discussion and suggestions for improvements.</p>"
