    abstract:
    - content: "<p>Although the Session Initiation Protocol (SIP) includes a suite
        of security services that has been expanded by numerous specifications over
        the years, there is no single place that explains how to use SIP to establish
        confidential media sessions. Additionally, existing mechanisms have some feature
        gaps that need to be identified and resolved in order for them to address
        the pervasive monitoring threat model. This specification describes best practices
        for negotiating confidential media with SIP, including a comprehensive protection
        solution that binds the media layer to SIP layer identities.</p>"
