    - content: "<p>The ultimate goal is to make the route to these sources of information
        invisible to you. At present, this is not easy to do. I will explain some
        of the techniques that can be used to make these nuggets easier to pick up
        so that we all can be richer. This RFC provides information for the Internet
        community. It does not specify an Internet standard.</p>"
