    abstract:
    - content: "<p>As the Internet has grown, and as systems and networked services
        within enterprises have become more pervasive, many services with high availability
        requirements have emerged. These requirements have increased the demands on
        the reliability of the infrastructure on which those services rely.</p><p>Various
        techniques have been employed to increase the availability of services deployed
        on the Internet. This document presents commentary and recommendations for
        distribution of services using anycast. This document specifies an Internet
        Best Current Practices for the Internet Community, and requests discussion
        and suggestions for improvements.</p>"
