    abstract:
    - content: "<p>The User Datagram Protocol (UDP) provides a minimal message-passing
        transport that has no inherent congestion control mechanisms. This document
        provides guidelines on the use of UDP for the designers of applications, tunnels,
        and other protocols that use UDP. Congestion control guidelines are a primary
        focus, but the document also provides guidance on other topics, including
        message sizes, reliability, checksums, middlebox traversal, the use of Explicit
        Congestion Notification (ECN), Differentiated Services Code Points (DSCPs),
        and ports.</p><p>Because congestion control is critical to the stable operation
        of the Internet, applications and other protocols that choose to use UDP as
        an Internet transport must employ mechanisms to prevent congestion collapse
        and to establish some degree of fairness with concurrent traffic. They may
        also need to implement additional mechanisms, depending on how they use UDP.</p><p>Some
        guidance is also applicable to the design of other protocols (e.g., protocols
        layered directly on IP or via IP-based tunnels), especially when these protocols
        do not themselves provide congestion control.</p><p>This document obsoletes
        RFC 5405 and adds guidelines for multicast UDP usage.</p>"
