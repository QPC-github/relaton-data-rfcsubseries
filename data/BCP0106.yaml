    abstract:
    - content: "<p>Security systems are built on strong cryptographic algorithms that
        foil pattern analysis attempts. However, the security of these systems is
        dependent on generating secret quantities for passwords, cryptographic keys,
        and similar quantities. The use of pseudo-random processes to generate secret
        quantities can result in pseudo-security. A sophisticated attacker may find
        it easier to reproduce the environment that produced the secret quantities
        and to search the resulting small set of possibilities than to locate the
        quantities in the whole of the potential number space.</p><p>Choosing random
        quantities to foil a resourceful and motivated adversary is surprisingly difficult.
        This document points out many pitfalls in using poor entropy sources or traditional
        pseudo-random number generation techniques for generating such quantities.
        It recommends the use of truly random hardware techniques and shows that the
        existing hardware on many systems can be used for this purpose. It provides
        suggestions to ameliorate the problem when a hardware solution is not available,
        and it gives examples of how large such quantities need to be for some applications.
        This document specifies an Internet Best Current Practices for the Internet
        Community, and requests discussion and suggestions for improvements.</p>"
