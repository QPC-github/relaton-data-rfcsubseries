    abstract:
    - content: "<p>ISO/IEC 10646-1 defines a large character set called the Universal
        Character Set (UCS) which encompasses most of the world's writing systems.
        The originally proposed encodings of the UCS, however, were not compatible
        with many current applications and protocols, and this has led to the development
        of UTF-8, the object of this memo. UTF-8 has the characteristic of preserving
        the full US-ASCII range, providing compatibility with file systems, parsers
        and other software that rely on US-ASCII values but are transparent to other
        values. This memo obsoletes and replaces RFC 2279.</p>"
