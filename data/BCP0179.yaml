    abstract:
      content: "<p>The Kerberos 5 network authentication protocol, originally specified
        in RFC 1510, can use the Data Encryption Standard (DES) for encryption. Almost
        30 years after first publishing DES, the National Institute of Standards and
        Technology (NIST) finally withdrew the standard in 2005, reflecting a long-established
        consensus that DES is insufficiently secure. By 2008, commercial hardware
        costing less than USD 15,000 could break DES keys in less than a day on average.
        DES is long past its sell-by date. Accordingly, this document updates RFC
        1964, RFC 4120, RFC 4121, and RFC 4757 to deprecate the use of DES, RC4-HMAC-EXP,
        and other weak cryptographic algorithms in Kerberos. Because RFC 1510 (obsoleted
        by RFC 4120) supports only DES, this document recommends the reclassification
        of RFC 1510 as Historic. This memo documents an Internet Best Current Practice.</p>"
