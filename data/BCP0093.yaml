    abstract:
      content: '<p>The IETF has designed process changes over the last ten years in
        one of two ways: announcement by the IESG, sometimes based on informal agreements
        with limited community involvement and awareness, and formal use of the same
        mechanism used for protocol specification. The first mechanism has often proven
        to be too lightweight, the second too heavyweight.</p><p>This document specifies
        a middle-ground approach to the system of making changes to IETF process,
        one that relies heavily on a "propose and carry out an experiment, evaluate
        the experiment, and then establish permanent procedures based on operational
        experience" model rather than those previously attempted. This document specifies
        an Internet Best Current Practices for the Internet Community, and requests
        discussion and suggestions for improvements.</p>'
