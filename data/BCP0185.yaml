    abstract:
      content: "<p>Deployment of BGP origin validation that is based on the Resource
        Public Key Infrastructure (RPKI) has many operational considerations. This
        document attempts to collect and present those that are most critical. It
        is expected to evolve as RPKI-based origin validation continues to be deployed
        and the dynamics are better understood.</p>"
