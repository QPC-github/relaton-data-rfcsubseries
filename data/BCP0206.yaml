    abstract:
    - content: "<p>In Traffic-Engineered (TE) systems, it is sometimes desirable to
        establish an end-to-end TE path with a set of constraints (such as bandwidth)
        across one or more networks from a source to a destination. TE information
        is the data relating to nodes and TE links that is used in the process of
        selecting a TE path. TE information is usually only available within a network.
        We call such a zone of visibility of TE information a domain. An example of
        a domain may be an IGP area or an Autonomous System.</p><p>In order to determine
        the potential to establish a TE path through a series of connected networks,
        it is necessary to have available a certain amount of TE information about
        each network. This need not be the full set of TE information available within
        each network but does need to express the potential of providing TE connectivity.
        This subset of TE information is called TE reachability information.</p><p>This
        document sets out the problem statement for the exchange of TE information
        between interconnected TE networks in support of end-to-end TE path establishment
        and describes the best current practice architecture to meet this problem
        statement. For reasons that are explained in this document, this work is limited
        to simple TE constraints and information that determine TE reachability.</p>"
