    - content: "<p>The K-12 community traditionally has not had this level of staffing
        available for telecommunications planning. This document is intended to bridge
        that gap and provides a recommended technical direction, an introduction to
        the role the Internet now plays in K-12 education and technical guidelines
        for building a campus data communications infrastructure that provides internetworking
        services and connections to the Internet. This memo provides information for
        the Internet community. This memo does not specify an Internet standard of
        any kind.</p>"
